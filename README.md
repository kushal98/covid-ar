This app lets you display the current spread of covid-19 in augmented reality with real-time data.
You can place a globe and look at regions. When you tap on a country, you can view more details.

## Data Source

We are using the API from this project: https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api

It uses the data by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).
The data is updated every hour.
